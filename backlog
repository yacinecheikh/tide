add shortcuts to move camera
(horizontal and vertical sliders)




HUD outside of AST
(ex: framerate watcher top right of the screen)
(currently impossible since Display can only display 1 element and AST takes the main spot with (0, 0))
(ex: notifications toasts)

DOM-like text+children mixing



later:
-auto-replace rendering of complex or long expressions/blocks with simpler docstring
-add custom node type support (ex: literals for arrays, linked lists, hash tables,...)
-visual indicators like *, <-, numbers,... in different colors to indicate bookmarks
(ex: write in red the bookmark id/number besides the first/middle line of the node)
-> requires complex rendering instructions (multiple renderings per line)
-> for now: cyan backgrounds for bookmark headers


Node:
-add optional footer along with headers
-mix nodes and texts in children content


bookmarks:
behaviour:
-erase previous bookmark when defining a new one
-allow multiple bookmarks for organized numbered nodes
(persistent and automated bookmarks)
(local or unique bookmarks to navigate)
(could be used like goto labels, not necessarily with numbers)
